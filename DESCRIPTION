Description: The string "bird.carp.7TsBWtwqtKAeCTNk8f" is a "QQID":
             a representation of a 128-bit number, constructed
             from two "cues" of short, common, English words, and
             Base64 encoded characters.  The primary intended use of
             QQIDs is as random unique identifiers, e.g. database
             keys like the "UUIDs" defined in the RFC 4122 Internet
             standard.  QQIDs can be identically interconverted with
             UUIDs, IPv6 addresses, MD5 hashes etc., and are suitable
             for a host of applications in which identifiers are read
             by humans.   They are compact, can safely be transmitted
             in binary and text form, can be used as components of
             URLs, and it can be established at a glance whether two
             QQIDs are different or potentially identical.  The qqid
             package contains functions to retrieve true, quantum-random
             QQIDs, to generate pseudo- random QQIDs, to validate
             them, and to interconvert them with other 128-bit number
             representations.
