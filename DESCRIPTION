Description: QQIDs are a representation of 128-bit numbers constructed from
             two "cues" of short, common, English words, and Base64 encoded
             characters. Like RFC 4122 UUIDs, with which they can be identically
             interconverted, QQIDs are suitable as random unique identifiers for
             use as database keys and in a host of other applications. However
             they are more compact than UUIDs and it can be established at a
             glance whether two keys are different or potentially identical.
             The qqid package contains functions to generate true random and
             pseudo-random QQIDs, to validate them, and to interconvert them
             with other 128-bit number representations.
             "bird.carp.7TsBWtwqtKAeCTNk8f" is an example.
