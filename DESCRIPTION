Description: QQIDs are a representation of 128-bit numbers constructed
             from two "cues" of short, common, English words, and Base64
             encoded characters. Their primary intended use is for random
             unique identifiers, e.g. database keys, like RFC 4122 UUIDs.
             QQIDs can be identically interconverted with UUIDs, IPv6
             addresses, MD5 hashes etc., and are suitable for a host of
             applications in which identifiers are read by humans. They
             are compact, can safely be transmitted in binary and text
             form, are useable in URLs, and it can be established at a
             glance whether two QQIDs are different or potentially
             identical. The qqid package contains functions to generate
             true random and pseudo-random QQIDs, to validate them, and
             to interconvert them with other 128-bit number representations.
             An example QQID is bird.carp.7TsBWtwqtKAeCTNk8f .
