# ==== setup ===================================================================
#
# Note: the tests are not entirely RNG-safe i.e. it is not guaranteed that the
#       global state of the RNG is unchanged if testing aborts with an error.
#       To achieve that, we would need to wrap this test in a function
#       and then do the restorative assign() in an on.exit() call. Not doing
#       that for the sake of clarity in the testing code.
