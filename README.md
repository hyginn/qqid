## `bird.carp.7TsBWtwqtKAeCTNk8f`

This is a **QQID**. It is one of 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456
unique numbers that can be produced in this format. That's ~3 x 10<sup>38</sup>, or three hundred and forty undecillion. That's approximately the number of atoms in 3 cubic kilometres of water.  There is no process that would reasonably produce `bird.carp.7TsBWtwqtKAeCTNk8f` again. `bird.carp.7TsBWtwqtKAeCTNk8f` was forged in Australia in a machine that measures the inherent randomness of quantum fluctuations of the vacuum, it was interpreted and formatted in Canada, stored in GitHub's data cloud, and visualized by you. Yet, I would immediately recognize that a number in one of my documents might be this one: Hello, _bird carp_! That's what makes QQIDs interesting.

# 1 Overview:

_QQIDs_ are a representation of [128-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/128-bit) numbers constructed from two "cues" of short, common, English words, and [`Base64`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoded characters. Their primary intended use is for random unique identifiers, e.g. database keys, like [`RFC 4122 UUIDs`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122). _QQIDs_ can be identically interconverted with [_UUIDs_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier), [_IPv6_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6) addresses, [_MD5_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) hashes etc., and are suitable for a host of applications in which identifiers are read by humans. They are compact, can safely be transmitted in binary and text form, are useable in [_URLs_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL), and it can be established at a glance whether two _QQIDs_ are different or potentially identical. The [`qqid` package](https://github.com/hyginn/qqid) contains functions to generate true random and pseudo-random _QQIDs_, to validate them, and to interconvert them with other 128-bit number representations. 

## 1.1 Redux of use

To use between 1 and ~ 1000 QQIDs at a time, create a closure, possibly in your `.Rprofile` session initialization:

```R
qQQID <- qQQIDfactory()
```
Creating the closure and filling its cache with random numbers from the quantum random server at ANU takes a few seconds. After that, QQID keys are quickly available.

```R
qQQID(3)

# Conceptually ...
N <- length(myFancyData)
myDat = data.frame(ID = qQQID(N),
                   dat = myFancyData,
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```

To use many QQIDs all at once, use `rngQQID(n)`. This will take a few seconds to get a seed from the quantum-fluctuation randomness server at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra. But you can then generate many sane IDs in a short time. A million? Yes, takes a bit over two minutes. See the examples in the validation section below. 

&nbsp;

## 1.1 Random unique identifiers and UUIDs

There are many uses for 128-bit numbers (or _"hexlets"_), IPv6 addresses for example, or Md5 hashes. But the design use case for QQIDs is for _random unique identifiers_, and in that respect QQIDs are similar to ["UUID"s (Universally Unique ID)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) - which are a popular type of random unique identifier that is in widespread use.

Random unique identifiers are great wherever unique IDs are needed and we have little or no control over who creates them. A typical use case might be to manage observations by a loosely knit group of researchers who contribute data to a common project. The IDs they use on their local machines be preserved once the observations are uploaded, so that they can stably cross-reference them with their notes - but we don't know who the contributors are so we can't provide them with dedicated ranges of identifiers, or they might contribute only intermittently, and for us to administer contributor-specific ID prefixes would become a significant effort. However, it still must be guaranteed that **every key is unique**. Random unique identifiers solve this problem by drawing IDs randomly from a very large space of numbers. This means: it is _possible_ that two such IDs could collide by chance. But in practice, since e.g. a random UUID - is drawn from 2<sup>122</sup> numbers, the chance of observing the same number again is 1 / 5.3e36 - and that is less than winning the 6 of 49 lottery **five times in a row**.  

UUIDs are defined in an RFC of the governing body of the Internet - [RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) - and they are formatted in a characteristic way from strings of `8-4-4-4-12` hyphen-separated hexadecimal characters.

```text
f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6
```
(A canonical example of a UUID (from [RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122)).)

Six bits of a UUID are reserved for embedding information about how it was constructed, these six bits are no longer random (some UUID classes have even less randomness). Therefore the number space for RFC-conformant UUIDs is 2<sup>122</sup>, not 2<sup>128</sup>. Of course, you are not prevented from just using fully-random 128-bit numbers, and all such numbers can be translated into valid QQIDs (in fact `rngQQID()` explicitly provides that option). But strictly speaking, even though you can encode such a number in hexadecimal characters and add the correct pattern of hyphens, you might not want to call that a UUID anymore. Does it matter? Not until it did and something breaks. Other than that, UUIDs are a perfectly sane approach to representing 128-bit numbers and to share them across a wide variety of media, applications and channels.

There are several convenient sources for UUIDs in R: Simon Urbanek's [**uuid** package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=uuid) provides pseudo-random UUIDs with the `UUIDgenerate()` function. This is convenient, but can be compromised by a poorly initialized random number generator; those UUIDs are generated one at a time. Siegfried KÃ¶stlmeier's [**qrandom** package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qrandom) includes the `qUUID()` function that queries the API of the [QRNG](https://qrng.anu.edu.au/API/api-demo.php) server in Canberra, Australia, from where it retrieves high-bandwidth, true random numbers from measurements of quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. Those are true random UUIDs that conform to [RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) - and as long as quantum randomness is not exhausted, those will not recur. As an aside, qUUIDs are returned in batches of up to 1023 numbers and that can incur significant latency. The `qqid` package has a closure generator `qQQIDfactory()`, which returns QQIDs conveniently from a cache, and `rngQQID()` can generate any number of UUIDs from the internal RNG using a sane random seed strategy.

Bottom line: there already exist perfectly sane ways to generate UUIDs as random unique identifiers.

&nbsp;

## 1.2 The need for humane numbers ...

So, what is the problem that QQIDs address?

While UUIDs are an excellent technical solution for the internals of data management systems, they are hard to distinguish by eye.

    c59db976-e141-3d32-db89-cc071401fe8d
```

Practice shows that when we put them into spreadsheets during data entry, or need to tell them apart during testing and debugging of analysis code, it is surprisingly useful to be able to tell UUIDs apart by actually looking at them. UUIDs are also quite long and this may make them awkward to manage in tables, or reports. Curiously, the very existence of hyphens in UUIDs (or colons in IPv6 addresses) shows that the format was specified with consideration for human readability. Yet such readability can be much improved.

&nbsp;

## 1.3 The QQID concept

QQIDs are a formatted variant of 128-bit numbers. A QQID converts the first 20 bit (five hexadecimal characters) of the number to two integers (0, 1023), and uses the integers to pick two "Q-words" words from a table of English four-letter, monosyllabic words. 

```text

|--0x[1]--| |--0x[2]--| |--0x[3]--| |--0x[4]--| |--0x[5]--|    5-hexadecimals
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00    20-bit
|----------int[1]-----------| |----------int[2]-----------|    2 integers (0, 1023)

```

Taken by themselves, there are only on the order of 10<sup>6</sup> possible combinations of the Q-words. But we are not replacing the 128-bit number, we are just representing its first twenty bits differently, and none of the randomness gets lost. IDs that begin with different words are necessarily different. IDs that begin with the same words could be different - one needs to consider the rest of the ID. However the likelihood of them having the same QQ head while actually having a different tail is small enough for any use case in which we would actually be looking at QQIDs with our own eyes; reasonably that would limit the number to, say, 1,000 IDs, and a thousand doublets of Q-words have a collision probability of less than 0.4 .

```R
R > stats::pbirthday(n = 1000, classes = 1024^2, coincident = 2)
[1] 0.3790544

```

Even though the words are random, the labels makes QQIDs easily distinguishable.

```

Quiz: look at these ten numbers. Have you seen any of them before? Exactly! Hello again, _bird carp_.

The remaining 108 bits are simply converted to 18 groups of 6-bit patterns, i.e. "octlets", and these are encoded in a standard [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoding.

The nice thing here is that any UUID can be uniquely represented as a QQID, and uniquely recovered from that representation. QQIDs are fully backwards compatible with UUIDs, and by default the tools of the `qqid` package construct them to be forward compatible as well: unless explicitly instructed to disregard RFC 4122 compliance, a QQID can be converted into a valid "UUID v4".

## 1.4  Q-words

Q-words are the key to making QQIDs useful. Q-words (from "cue") are all the same length, so they align well in layout and tables, don't need to be padded to represent numbers, and they can be retrieved from a QQID with a simple `substr(x, 1, 4)` and `substr(x, 6, 9)`call. Three letter English words don't quite have the required variety to come up with pleasant, easily recognizable words. Five letter words are way more than we need. But four-letter English words are a good source, even though they are notoriously not all suited for polite conversation. A table of 1,024 four-letter words was hand-picked from a large frequency-sorted dictionary to yield short, unique words that ...

* are monosyllabic (no `lama` or `lazy`),
* are easy to spell and pronounce (no `czar`, no `adze`, no `cwms`),
* are individually not offensive (no `jerk`, no `ditz` etc. etc. etc.),
* are unlikely to be offensive in random combination (either `bait` or `jail` but not both, `ugly`, `cuts`, `pink`, and `vein` are others that got into trouble...),
* are in common use (no `jape`, no `hale`),
* avoid homophones (not `vane` and `vain`), and consonant clusters (no `tact`, `alps`, or `acts`),
* do not contain jargon (`noob`, `geek`, `dude`, `woke`), slang (`whiz`, `geez`, `yuck`), intentional misspellings (`trax`, `fuze`), acronyms (`cran`, `ftfy`, `nsfw`), texting expressions (`myob`, `yolo`, `fomo`), abbreviations (`abbr`, `euro`, `spec`, `zine`), brands (`coke`, `nike`, `ford`), or overly specialized technical (`trie`, `fifo`) or sports terms (`puck`, `fore`, `goon`, `bunt` and `punt`, `sack`, `colt`) ...,
* and finally, there is no `bomb`, `gore` and `kill`, but there is `moon`, `hugs`, and `grin` - that's just the author's prerogative.

The resulting combinations may be evocative but not crass, they should be memorable but somewhat generic, and they should impart a "personality" to an abstract key that helps manage it wherever human interaction is a part of the workflow. 

The full list of Q-words is appended to this document.

## 1.5 Binary to text encoding schemes

In QQIDs, 20 bits of 128-bit numbers are mapped to Q-words, the remaining 108 bits needed to be otherwise encoded. Among [common choices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-to-text_encoding) we find:

```text
    Encoding:   Alphabet
      128-bit:  01
        octal:  01234567
      base 10:  0123456789
  hexadecimal:  0123456789abcdef
         UUID:  0123456789abcdef-
       Base64:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-_
         QQID:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-_.
      Ascii85:  !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?`ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[~]^@_abcdefghijklmnopqrstu
  ZeroMQ(Z85):  0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.-:+=^!/*?&<>()[]{}@%$#
```

&nbsp;

#### 1.5.1  Efficiency of representation

Since different encodings use different-length alphabets they result in different length encoded strings for the same 128-bit number:

```text
    128-bit:   00001100010001100000111011010011101100000001010110101101110000101010101101001010000000011110000010010011001101100100111100011111
      octal: 0o142140732354012655605255120036022315447437
    base 10:   16314497454888739773185192815022722847
       UUID:   0c460ed3-b015-adc2-ab4a-01e093364f1f
hexadecimal: 0x0c460ed3b015adc2ab4a01e093364f1f
       QQID:   bird.carp.7TsBWtwqtKAeCTNk8f
 Base64 (1):   DEYO07AVrcKrSgHgkzZPHw
    Ascii85:   $q:`UYSF:WX%EENP;Z2Y
ZeroMQ(Z85):   3}p-QUOBpST4AAJLqVhU
```

`(1)`: since 128 is not divisible by 6, the 128 bit string is padded with 4 zeroes before converting to hexadecimal characters.

All the above encodings use ASCII character sets. An ASCII character can be encoded in 7 bits, but in practice characters are stored in 8 bits anyway. So lets assume 8 bits per character. How many bits do we need, to store 128 bits in the various character encoding schemes? Efficiency is the amount of storage needed for an encoding scheme vs. the 128 bits of information it contains ...

```text
       128-bit:   000011000... 128 character  896 bit  14.3 % efficiency
         octal: 0o142140732...  42 character  294 bit  43.5 % efficiency
       base 10:   163144974...  38 character  266 bit  48.1 % efficiency
          UUID:   0c460ed3-...  36 character  252 bit  50.8 % efficiency
   hexadecimal: 0x0c460ed3b...  32 character  224 bit  57.1 % efficiency
       QQID(1):   bird.carp...  28 character  196 bit  65.3 % efficiency
    Base64 (2):   DEYO07AVr...  22 character  154 bit  83.1 % efficiency
       Ascii85:   $q:`UYSF:...  20 character  140 bit  91.4 % efficiency
ZeroMQ(Z85)(3):   3}p-QUOBp...  20 character  140 bit  91.4 % efficiency
   Q-words (4):   bird.carp.vine.vent.call.rump.de...  28.6 % efficiency
```

(1) If we were to restrict ourselves to QQIDS that can be converted to [RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) compliant UUIDs, we would get away with one less character. This benefit is minimal vs. the loss of generality.
(2) If character-based encoding were the sole objective, Base64 would be hard to beat. The efficiency gain with Ascii85 is marginal.

## 1.6 exploring randomness of `rngQQID()`

It has been reported that applications that use UUIDs have experienced collisions. That's concerning and points to the difficulty of seeding RNGs well, in particularly from processes that only use a comparatively small initialization space - time and process ID - or worse, encode MAC addresses or timestamps in their supposedly random bits. The problem is exacerbated when processes are parallelized, and tasks take the RNG initialization state with them. That, incidentally, is a conceivable failure mode also in `qqid` applications.

But what about the properties of QQIDs? 

We can trust the underlying randomness of the IDs that `rngQQID()` returns to the same degree that we trust R's RNG in the first place: the  process is simply a mapping from `sample(c(0, 1), 128 * n, replace = TRUE)`. But we need to verify that the transformation is correct and we can check that indeed no collisions have occurred. 

```R
# one million QQIDs
system.time(
  x1 <- rngQQID(1e6)   # Default: uses a large integer seed from ANU 
)   
   user  system elapsed 
144.137   2.225 146.672 

# Repeat: another milion for a total of 2e06 QQIDs from two independent runs.
# For demonstration, we fetch a reasonably sane seed fom ANU, set the RNG
# outside of the function and then churn away. Note: this is method "n" -
# "NO change of the existing .Random.seed . That's fast, but 
set.seed(qrandom::qrandommaxint())  # quantum random seed
system.time(x2 <- rngQQID(1e6, method = "n"))   # one more million QQIDs
   user  system elapsed 
145.200   2.501 150.353  
R > system.time(print(any(duplicated(c(x1, x2)))))  # any collisions?
[1] FALSE                                           #  :-)
   user  system elapsed 
  0.137   0.011   0.148 
  
```

Explore the distribution of encoding characters:

```R
substr(x1[1], 11, 28)
 [1] "gIwb9mpJXdmx4-f8Uu"
 
system.time(myTab <- table(unlist(strsplit(substr(c(x1,x2), 11, 28), ""))))
   user  system elapsed 
  9.239   1.119  10.561 

sd(myTab)/mean(myTab)
[1] 0.1681171              # Woah - that's very much more than we would expect:

# Expected:
myInt <- sample(1:64, 36e6, replace = TRUE)
myItab <- table(myInt)
sd(myItab) / mean(myItab)
[1] 0.001075801

barplot(sort(myTab),
        ylim = c(0, 1e6),
        col = c(rep("#DAE9F0", 27),
                rep("#ADC9D9", 27),
                rep("#829CBA",  9),
                rep("#325087",  1)),
        border = NA,
        ylab = "counts",

```
![](https://raw.github.com/hyginn/qqid/master/inst/img/barplotRFC4122conforming.svg?sanitize=true "barplot of UUID conforming BASE64 characters")

The barplot shows that classes of characters have discretely different frequencies. The reason for this is immediately obvious: QQIDs that are created to be convertible to RFC 4122 compliant UUIDs have six non-random bits, and those are not aligned with the encoding character boundaries. Since the distribution of the underlying 128-bit patterns is not uniformly random, neither is the distribution of the encoding characters. However the distribution of numbers that underlie our QQIDs is just as random as 2^122 bits suggests.

Let's repeat the process with fully random 128-bit numbers:

```R
# repeat with fully random QQIDs (RFC4122compliant = FALSE)
set.seed(qrandom::qrandommaxint())
system.time(x3 <- rngQQID(1e6, method = "n", RFC4122compliant = FALSE))
   user  system elapsed 
162.261   2.765 165.781 

set.seed(qrandom::qrandommaxint())
system.time(x4 <- rngQQID(1e6, method = "n", RFC4122compliant = FALSE))
   user  system elapsed 
157.720   2.333 160.218 

system.time(myRTab <- table(unlist(strsplit(substr(c(x3,x4), 11, 28), ""))))

As expected, all encoding characters are equally likely.

Finally, let's look at the distribution of Q-words:

```R
q1Tab <- table(c(substr(x1, 1, 4), substr(x1, 6, 9))) 
q2Tab <- table(c(substr(x2, 1, 4), substr(x2, 6, 9))) 
q3Tab <- table(c(substr(x3, 1, 4), substr(x3, 6, 9))) 
q4Tab <- table(c(substr(x4, 1, 4), substr(x4, 6, 9))) 
sd(q1Tab) / mean(q1Tab)
  [1] 0.02227552
  
plot(1:1024, sort(q1Tab),
     xlab = "Q-word rank",
     ylim = c(1780, 2120),
     yaxt = "n",
     ylab = "counts",
     type = "l",
     lwd = 1.5,
     col = "#715FFF",
     cex.axis = 0.8)
axis(side =  2, at = seq(1800, 2200, by = 100), labels = NULL)
lines(1:1024, sort(q2Tab), type = "l", col = "#8C48E8")
lines(1:1024, sort(q3Tab), type = "l", col = "#D950E4")
lines(1:1024, sort(q4Tab), type = "l", col = "#FF4FB0")

# There are no visibly over- or underrepresented Q-words

```
![](https://raw.github.com/hyginn/qqid/master/inst/img/Q-wordRanks.svg?sanitize=true "Ranks of 4 * 2e+06 Q-words")
Counts for 4 runs of 2e+06 Q-words, ranked by count from 1 to 1024 show no apparent deviation from what is expected from random choices.

In summary: we appear to be rolling a fair die when we construct QQIDs, and we appear to
interpret the underlying large numbers in an unbiased way.

## Issues with setting `.Random.seed`, or not ...

```R
# Here's an aside: in order to play nice with other applications, rngQQID() does
# NOT change the global .Random.seed, but resets it to the state it was found
# in. However this means, if you generate the same number of QQIDs again
# WITHOUT making a new seed, you'll be creating the exact same binary matrix
# that you had before, and your new QQIDs WILL be the exact same numbers we had
# before. Seriously ! The good news is that that's easy to spot - just compare
# the head() of the vector.


set.seed(qrandom::qrandommaxint())      # set a quantum random seed
myIDs <- rngQQID(1e4, method = "n")     # generate a few thousand QQIDs
head(myIDs)                             # inspect them
                                        # repeat WITHOUT a new seed
rngQQID(6, method = "n")                # Whoa! Exactly the same QQIDs again ...
rngQQID(6, method = "n")                # ... and again.

rngQQID(6, method = "R")   # Use R's initialization: internally set.seed(NULL).
rngQQID(6, method = "n")   # ... but "n" gives us the same IDs as before.
```

Bottom line: try not to use method `"n"` unless you understand the risks and benefits. When you do,
you **MUST** set a sane seed before each run. But why are we doing this 
in the first place? Why can't we just reset the seed every time? The reason
is that `.Random.seed` is a global parameter, and unless it is explicitly 
asked to do so, a function should never change global parameters. Here's how
this is good:

```R

                 #                  We set up a reproducible computational 
set.seed(112358) #                  experiment, ...
runif(1)         # [1] 0.3187551    that involves getting a random number ...
runif(1)         # [1] 0.7404076    and another one.

# Next we do the same thing, but this time we generate a QQID between the two
# calls to runif(). Method "R" resets .Random.seed inside the function.

set.seed(112358)
runif(1)                  # [1] 0.3187551   As expected, same as above ...
rngQQID(1, method = "R")  # [1] "lute.most.Zg21LpZDlBQ88ivU-c"
rngQQID(1, method = "R")  # [1] "west.harm.sqLGZgdM0ZdCcrmED-"    Different!
runif(1)                  # [1] 0.7404076   That's what we had before!

# Since we put everything back in its place when we exited rngQQID(),
# the second number is still reproducible!
```

# 2 Functions in `qqid`

&nbsp;

The following functions are included in the `qqid` package:

&nbsp;

## 2.1 `qQQIDfactory()`

`qQQIDfactory` returns a closure (a function with an associated environment) that retrieves, caches, and returns true random QQIDs from the quantum-random number server at ANU.

&nbsp;

## 2.2 `rngQQID()`
`rngQQID()` uses R's random number generator to generate a vector of pseudo-random QQIDs. There are options to use a true-random seed, R's inbuilt RNG initialization, or to pass-through an external seed. The function is "RNG-safe", it does not change the global `.Random.seed`.

&nbsp;

## 2.3 `is.QQID()` and `is.xlt()`

`is.QQID()` tests whether the function argument is a vector of valid QQIDs. `is.UUID()` does the same for UUIDs, Md5 hashes, IPv6 addresses, or other 32-digit hexadecimal numbers (hexlets).

&nbsp;

## 2.4 `xlt2qq()` and `qq2uu()`

`xlt2qq()` converts a vector of UUIDs, Md5 hashes, IPv6 addresses, or other 32-digit hexadecimal numbers (hexlets) to QQIDs. `qq2uu()` converts QQIDs to UUIDs. 

&nbsp;

## 2.5 `QQIDexample()` and `xltIDexample()`

`QQIDexample()` returns synthetic, valid QQIDs for testing and development, which are easy to distinguish from "real" QQIDs to prevent their accidental use as IDs. `xltIDexample()` does the same for "UUIDs"hexlets, which it presents in a named vector in different formats:

```R
xltIDexample()
                                     md5  
       "11111111111111111111111111111111"
                                     hex
     "0x22222222222222222222222222222222" 
                                    UUID  
   "33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333"
                                    IPv6
"4444:4444:4444:4444:4444:4444:4444:4444" 
                                     hEx 
     "0x55555555aaaaaaaa66666666BBBBBBBB" 
```

&nbsp;

## 2.4 `qMap()`

`qMap` maps numbers to Q-words, or Q-words to their index in (0, 1023). `qMap(0:1023)` returns the full list of 1024 Q-words (see appendix).

&nbsp;

## 2.5 `oltMap()`

`oltMap` maps 6-digit bit pattern strings (octlets) to their corresponding Base64 characters, or Base64 characters 6-digit bit patterns.

&nbsp;

# 3 The `qqid` GitHub project

The [latest development version of `qqid`](https://github.com/hyginn/qqid) is an RStudio project hosted on GitHub, and available for 
* download and experimentation to your local machine, 
* to be forked for collaboration and possible inclusion of pull-requests, and
* to file issues. 

To learn more about GRPS development (Github, R Package, rStudio), see the template packages [`rpt`](https://github.com/hyginn/rpt) and [`rptPlus`](https://github.com/hyginn/rptPlus).

# 5 FAQ

##### Can I edit my QQIDs? Could I create `some.fish.red_some-fish-blue`?
Of course you can, `is.QQID("some.fish.red_some-fish-blue")` returns `TRUE` since "some" and "fish" are Q-words and the rest are valid characters of Base64. You do realize that this is not a good random unique key - but you can use it anywhere uniqueness is not crucial  - cross-references in your lab notebook for example. The important things is, from **my** perspective, a string that you deliberately craft in any way is still just one of 3e38 numbers, and it won't interfere with my own _random_ QQIDs at all.

#### What if I change `bulk.skip.9zAY8L8jnyLuGYYHEq` to `this.task.9zAY8L8jnyLuGYYHEq`?
It's actually quite harmless to hand-pick specific Q-words for some semantic purpose. You may increase Q-word collisions significantly, but that doesn't matter since a QQID's uniqueness does not come from the Q-words alone, and the remaining 18 Base64 character encode a 108-bit number which is 3.2e+32, i.e. plenty of randomness. However, encoding semantic information in unique keys is almost always a bad idea. The world changes, but our keys should remain.

&nbsp;

# 6 Notes

###### To Do
 - Still need a sane workflow to reproduce package building from RStudio and catch all errors. Need to follow up. Missing: building pdf package documentation. Documentation on package build process from RStudio is not what it could be.
 - Package documentation shows that `\preformatted{ }` does not respect leading whitespace and line breaks in `xlt2qq()` doc header when converted to pdf. Need to follow up.
 - We could cache the first element of every run of an instance of `rngQQID()` in a session and warn about lack of sane initialization if we see repeats.
 - More formats for `qq2 ... : should be able to get a max-integer for set.seed().
 - Turn the README into a vignette?

# 8 Acknowledgements

I enjoyed contributing to Siegfried KÃ¶stlmeier's [`qrandom`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=qrandom) package, whose convenient interface to quantum random numbers at [ANU](https://qrng.anu.edu.au/) made `qqid` possible, since the concept of pseudo-random universal IDs is perhaps less sound than it might seem at first.
