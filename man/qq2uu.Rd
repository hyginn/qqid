\usage{
qq2uu(qq)
}
\arguments{
\item{qq}{(character) a vector of QQIDs}
}
\value{
(character)  a vector of UUIDs
}
\description{
\code{qq2uu} converts a vector of QQIDs to UUIDs.
}
\section{QQIDs}{
 QQIDs are specially formatted UUIDs. See \code{\link{uu2qq}}
  for the the motivation of mapping UUIDs to QQIDs and details on how QQIDs
  are structured. This function reverses the mapping exactly to recover the
  original UUID.
}

\section{Process}{
 To convert a QQID to a UUID, the two "Q-words" that head
  the QQID are mapped to their index in the 0:1023 Q-word vector (cf.
  \code{\link{qMap}}), and the indices are converted to two ten bit numbers.
  These twenty bits are expressed as a five-digit hexadecimal number which
  replaces the two Q-words to recover the UUID. For details on UUID format
  see \code{\link{is.UUID}}. The remaining 18 Base64 encoded characters are
  converted to their corresponding 27 hex digits via an intermediate mapping
  to bit-patterns.
}

\section{Endianness}{
 The \code{qqid} package uses its own functions to
  convert to and from bits, and is not affected by big-endian vs.
  little-endian processor architecture or variant byte order. All numbers are
  interpreted to have their lowest order digits on the right.

\examples{
# Convert three example QQIDs and one NA to the corresponding UUIDs
qq2uu( c(QQIDexample(c(1, 3, 5)), NA) )

# forward and back again
myID <- "bird.carp.7TsBWtwqtKAeCTNk8f"
myID == xlt2qq(qq2uu(myID))             # TRUE

# Confirm that example QQID No. 3 is formatted correctly as a UUID
qq2uu( QQIDexample(3) ) == xltIDexample("UUID")  # TRUE
